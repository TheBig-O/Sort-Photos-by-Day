# Sort Photos by Day
 Sort Webcam photos by day for easy archive or referencing

I have a web-camera connected to a Raspberry Pi that takes an image every minute of the day. This results in huge numbers of photos in the main photo directory where the images are stored. Since I don't know if I'll want to do something with these photos, I wanted a way to store them in easily accessible groups.

By organizing the photos into daily folders, I can quickly find the time period I need or simply clear out a collection of older images.

What might I do with the photos? Well, since they start before sunrise and continue through sunset, making a timelapse that spans a single day is strightforward.

If you wanted to get a bit more creative, as spring or fall come along, you could select a specific time from each day and show the progress of the season through the development of leaves or the changing of leaf colors. 

Either way, you'll have your photos organized in a way that supports whatever you may want to do.
